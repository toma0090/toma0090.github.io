<h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>My name is Laura Tomac, I am 21 years old, my mother is Ukrainian and my father is Turkish, I was born in Ukraine but then we moved to Turkey so my Turkish is better. While in Turkey, I studied political science and public administration at Bursa UludaÄŸ University. I decided to move to Canada because I didn't want to stay in Turkey anymore and I was not satisfied with the department I was studying, but I moved here alone. It was not very difficult to leave my family because I lived alone while studying in Bursa. It has always been my dream to study abroad since I was little and this dream came true when I least expected it.</p>

     <p>When I was in Turkey I worked as a sales consultant for a clothing company called <strong>Mango</strong>. I love working, I always push myself to my limits and strangely I do my work better when I am stressed, I always try to improve myself and I try to get out of my comfort zone and try new things.</p>
